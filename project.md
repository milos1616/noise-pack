# Description
A portable backpack for the purpose of making a large amount of noise etc. Fitted with an airhorn, speakers, possibly a light show.
# Notes
- A standard speaker probably too complex too connect with bluetooth to phones, prebuilt bluetooth system seems superior
- Use an esp or such to control trumpet with relay driver or just use manual switch
    - Manual switch much simpler and cheaper
    - Relay is cooler and allows for remote control of trumpet with app or program, since more features might be added later to the backpack, it might be better
    - Propably use manual switch for now and convert to relay later if needed
